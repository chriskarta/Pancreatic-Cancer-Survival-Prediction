    "**Introduction and Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies worldwide, with a five-year survival rate of less than 10% due to its late diagnosis and aggressive progression. Accurate prediction of patient survival at the time of diagnosis remains a critical challenge in oncology, limiting clinicians’ ability to personalize treatment and allocate resources effectively. With the increasing availability of clinical and genomic data, there is a growing opportunity to leverage machine learning to estimate patient outcomes and support evidence-based decision-making. \n"

    "**Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Pancreatic cancer is often diagnosed late and is difficult to treat, making it one of the deadliest cancers. Doctors lack accurate tools to predict how long a patient might survive, which limits personalized care. Although there is a lot of clinical and genomic data available, survival is still mainly predicted using general staging systems. This project aims to build a machine learning model that can better predict survival in pancreatic cancer patients, helping doctors make more informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By identifying high-risk individuals early, this tool can support treatment planning, improve patient counseling, and guide the selection of candidates for advanced therapies or clinical trials."

    "3.\tBuild a predictive machine learning model to estimate the overall survival status (alive vs. deceased) of pancreatic cancer patients at the time of sample collection or diagnosis.\n",
    "4.\tEvaluate model performance using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to ensure clinical relevance and reliability.\n",
    "5.\tInterpret model outputs to identify the most influential features contributing to survival predictions, thereby providing insights into potential prognostic biomarkers.\n",
    "6.\tDemonstrate potential clinical utility by outlining how the model could support risk stratification, personalized treatment planning, and early patient counseling in real-world oncology settings.\n"
